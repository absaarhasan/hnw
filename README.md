This was my first attempt at trying to work with the MEAN technology stack. As you can imagine, the code is a mess and it does not adhere to any know JS style guide. What's worse is that the product is incomplete, so that makes it even more difficult to follow the code.

But for me it was a useful project, and it is still a good demonstration of building single page application with a restful API. It also demonstrates a knowledge of node and mongo, and all of the basics of angular—such as the ui-router, and angular forms.

I also really like the respnosive nature of the display. The design is fully EM based, and you can zoom in and out as much as you want—the display will never break.
